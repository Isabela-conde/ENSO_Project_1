# ENSO_Project_1


ENSO characteristics depend on the background conditions of the tropical Pacific Ocean and the recent ~40-yr trend towards La Ni√±a-like conditions appears to be changing the character of ENSO cycle variability, favoring a shift towards more CP vs EP type ENSO variations. 

Q: are the changing background conditions favouring a different balance of ENSO feedbacks (e.g., zonal advective vs thermocline) that lead to changes in the relative frequency of EP and CP events? 


Suggested data and methods: Heat budget analysis for detrended and undetrended data from various long ocean reanalysis products to reveal the extent to which background conditions have affected the feedbacks and whether those differences are consistent with a shift in the distribution of CP/EP events.
